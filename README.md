# this-stuff-scripts

Sadly NoTwistedHere announced this in the discord today:

Been around making free scripts since December of 2019 and it's time to say goodbye

Thank you for all the support and all of the boosts; All scripts will be available for the next week before I delete them.
Go support @saucekid and his journey where you will find some good scripts for The Wild West and a few other games (https://discord.gg/7xKb8dcF4r)

Message from magma: Thank you for all that you have done for us, and I wish you the very best !
